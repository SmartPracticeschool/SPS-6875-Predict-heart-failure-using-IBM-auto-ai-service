# SPS-6875-Predict-heart-failure-using-IBM-auto-ai-service
Predict heart failure using IBM auto ai service

Project Description:

Project Description:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 9 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.
In this project, you need to build a model using Auto AI and build a web application where we can get the prediction of heart failure.
